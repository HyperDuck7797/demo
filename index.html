            <p>To be successful, one must first practice at that they wish to become successful in. Here we have an image of FHN student Daiyan Hassan, 2024 FBLA Economics National Champion, but Daiyan did not achieve this feat by simply participating in the event; he studied day in and out, going through countless nights without sleep, just to prepare himself for these events. Even through all of his studying, Daiyan never grew an ego, even as his event's winners were being called up, he had enough humility to not expect to place within the top ten, yet he still managed to achieve first place.</p>

            <p>Honestly, this web page is full of complete and utter nonsense, made purely for a video on how to host a website on github for Dr. Green. I could have just used a website from web design 1, but I just watched a javascript tutorial video and wanted to try it out</p>
